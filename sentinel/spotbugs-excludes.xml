  <!--
    The MockEntityReturnDriver and related classes provide a Type 4 JDBC driver
    implementation with a very narrow focus of reading sample data from files.
    By design, the JDBC user specifies a file that acts as an index between
    queries and XML files. These are test classes that are not used in production.
